test cases to check for:

~PRICELIST & DATE-AMOUNT FILE~
    - empty file
    - no file
    - non existent file
    - garbage file
    - valid values more than two separated by comma
    - invalid date
    - dates in the future
    - only spaces and commas
    - only newlines
    - " and commas
    - check for garbage before/between/after valid input -> should work but throw an error and continue processing data (?*)
    - throw appropriate message in case pricelist name has been changed
    -
